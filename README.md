How to Test
1. Run the application.
2. Utilize Swagger to post test data to the "Submit" endpoint.
3. Use Swagger to retrieve the result list from the "Approvers" endpoint.

Note: Prototype Project
This project is a prototype and should be treated as such. All implementations were designed for the purpose of solving the assignment, and I would not employ the exact same implementations in a real-world scenario.
Furthermore, for the sake of brevity and completing the assignment swiftly, I have made some concessions:
 - No Validation: Validation was not included in the assignment. In a real-world example, I would have used Fluent Validation.
 - Data Structure: Employees and their positions should ideally be stored in separate tables. Other structures could also be split, and abstraction could be employed depending on real-world requirements.
 - Unit Testing: Unit tests should be applied for each rule individually and also for the service.
 - Application Stability: The application may not function correctly as the focus was on conveying code style and coding approach, rather than robustness.
 - Interpretation of Requirements: Requirements seemed open to interpretation, so this is only one interpretation of the assignment. Changes can be made if/when requirements are clarified.
 - Etc.
